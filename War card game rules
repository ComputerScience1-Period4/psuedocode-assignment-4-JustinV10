Rules for War
The Setup:
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down, in front of him.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack. Joker>King>Queen>Jack>10>9>8>7>6>5>4>3>2>Ace(Beats ONLY king)

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher card on top takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, loop until one persons wins
this will be in a a loop until one person does not have any cards.
