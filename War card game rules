Rules for War
The Setup:
The deck is divided evenly, with each player (Max of 2 players) receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. 
Each player places his stack of cards face down, in front of them.

THE PLAY 
Player one puts down the top card from their half deck facing up, player 2 does the same
If one of the numbers is higher, the person who played that card wins and takes both of the cards. 
If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three card face down and one card face up. 
The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards).
If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, loop until one persons wins

The play will be looped until one person has all 52 cards.

Do they get to see the cards that they are placing down?
